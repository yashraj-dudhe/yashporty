# Advanced React Optimization Techniques

React applications can become slow as they grow. Here are proven techniques to keep your apps fast.

## 1. Memo and Callback Optimization

`javascript
import React, { memo, useCallback } from 'react';

const OptimizedComponent = memo(({ data, onUpdate }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onUpdate(data.id);
  }, [data.id, onUpdate]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{data.name}</button>;
});
`

## 2. Performance Results

- Before optimization: 2.3s load time
- After optimization: 0.6s load time
- Lighthouse score improved from 65 to 95
`

### Step 2: Update Your Blog List

Edit logs/blog-list.json to add your new blog:

    "content": "./blogs/react-optimization.md",
    "tags": ["React", "Performance", "JavaScript", "Optimization"],
    "date": "2024-12-20",
    "readTime": "10 min read"
  }
]
`

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

`ash
# Add your new files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new blog: Advanced React Optimization Techniques"

# Push to your repository
git push origin main
